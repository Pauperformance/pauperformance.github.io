                "description": "\nOrzhov Pestilence exploits the unique synergy between [Guardian of the Guildpact](https://scryfall.com/card/dis/10/guardian-of-the-guildpact) and [Pestilence](https://scryfall.com/card/mb1/729/pestilence), both to completely stall the board and as a final win condition.\nIn several matchups, Guardian of the Guildpact is impossible to remove thanks to its peculiar [protection ability](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Protection), that protects the creature from damage caused by Pestilence effect.\nAs result, the player is allowed to activate multiple times per turn Pestilence to wipe the board, while Guardian of the Guildpact will prevent the enchantment from leaving the battlefield.\n\nOrzhov Pestilence takes control of the board in early game by means of a variety of removal spells, while developing its mana to resolve Pestilence and Guardian of the Guildpact.\nIn versions of the deck with a strong focus on the control strategy, a key card is [Pristine Talisman](https://scryfall.com/card/c21/258/pristine-talisman), to [ramp](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Ramp) while keeping up the life total.\nDiscard effects are common in this archetype and typically represent the only way to deal with counterspells and strong [enters the battlefield](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Enters_the_battlefield) effects.\n\nThe deck is sometimes considered unstable due to the high number of lands it requires, and to the absence of an efficient card selection and draw engine after [Bonder's Ornament](https://scryfall.com/card/c20/67/bonders-ornament) ban.",
