                "description": "\nBogles is an explosive aggro deck based around cheap creatures with [Hexproof](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Hexproof) or similar abilities, such as [Slippery Bogle](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/223/slippery-bogle), [Gladecover Scout](https://scryfall.com/card/m14/176/gladecover-scout), and [Silhana Ledgewalker](https://scryfall.com/card/pca/77/silhana-ledgewalker).\nIn a format dominated by cheap and efficient removals, Bogles players try to race their opponents from 20 to 0 with creatures having built-in protection.\nSince Bogles creatures cannot be targeted once on the board, opponents are left with a few options to deal with them.\nSome of those include sacrifice effects, such as [Chainer's Edict](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/89/chainers-edict), or (non-targeting) mass removals, such as [Fiery Cannonade](https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/178/fiery-cannonade), or creatures like [Standard bearer](https://scryfall.com/card/apc/18/standard-bearer).\n\nTo consistently win games in the first 4-5 turns, Bogles features a variety of enchantments to boost creatures' power and to grant useful combat abilities to its attackers, such as [Trample](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Trample) and [First Strike](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/First_strike).\nStaples of the archetype are [Rancor](https://scryfall.com/card/a25/186/rancor), [Ethereal Armor](https://scryfall.com/card/rtr/9/ethereal-armor), and [Armadillo Cloak](https://scryfall.com/card/ema/195/armadillo-cloak), that typically lead to a snowball effect in conjunction with [Ancestral Mask](https://scryfall.com/card/ema/157/ancestral-mask).\n\nTo fix its mana base, Bogles uses additional enchantments like [Abundant Growth](https://scryfall.com/card/ema/156/abundant-growth) and [Utopia Sprawl](https://scryfall.com/card/a25/192/utopia-sprawl), that also contribute to the offensive strategy.\n\nBogles is a non-interactive deck, with a fast clock, a low mana curve and all-in strategy that doesn't offer many mid/late-game options.\nHowever, given its popularity, opponents typically reserve sideboard slots for (mass) enchantment removals that can disrupt the aggro plan.",
