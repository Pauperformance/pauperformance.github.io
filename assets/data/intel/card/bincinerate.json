                "description": "\nBurn is a very aggressive deck trying to optimally chain a series of spells to directly damage the opponent.\nThe deck relies on few creatures that often amplify the damage caused by other spells, such as [Thermo-Alchemist](https://scryfall.com/card/mid/164/thermo-alchemist).\nFor this reason, they are often played in the early turns of the game.\n\nBurn requires careful sequencing and sometimes a lot of patience to play around counterspells.\nCommon decisions for Burn players often involve choosing whether to use removals on creatures or directly target the opponent.",
